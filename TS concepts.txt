TypeScript extends JavaScript (ECMAScript) by adding static typing and other advanced features that do not exist in vanilla JavaScript. 
Typescript is superset of javascript. 
JavaScript focuses on runtime features, while TypeScript focuses on static typing and compile-time checks.
Documentation Website: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
History:
====
TypeScript was developed by Microsoft, and it was first released in 2012.
Why was TS needed:
1. JavaScript is dynamically typed language, meaning types are determined at runtime. This often causes runtime errors that are hard to debug.
====
eg: (JavaScript Bug)
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(5, "10")); // "510" (Unexpected output)

Need for Static Typing was felt.
====
Typescript fix:
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(5, "10")); //  TypeScript Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to 'number'
=======

TypeScript prevents such errors at compile-time( before runtime).
JavaScript (since it’s interpreted) only catches errors at runtime,meaning some issues may appear after deployment.
TypeScript compiles to JavaScript (.ts → .js).
In Angular , application process TypeScript files using Angular CLI, 
which internally uses TypeScript Compiler (tsc) and Webpack for bundling.

=======
another eg:
Compile Time error (TS):->
let num: number = "Hello"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.TypeScript compiler (tsc) stops execution 

Runtime Error (JavaScript):->

function divide(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}

console.log(divide(10, 0)); // Infinity (No compile-time error, but logic issue)
console.log(x); //  ReferenceError: x is not defined (Runtime Error)


2. JavaScript lacks features like interfaces, namespaces, and strong OOP support, making it hard to maintain large applications.

3. TypeScript improves developer experience by code completion & IntelliSense in IDEs like VS Code.

Features:
=====
1. Static Typing
Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript allows you to specify types explicitly, catching errors at compile time

let name: string = "Alice"; //  Type is enforced
name = 42; //  Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'

2. Interfaces
Interfaces define the structure of objects and enforce type safety.

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const user: User = { id: 1, name: "Alice" }; // Works
const invalidUser: User = { id: "one", name: "Alice" }; //  Error

Interfaces and classes serve different primary purposes in TypeScript.
 Interfaces define contracts for the shape of objects, specifying required properties and methods without providing implementation details.
 Classes, on the other hand, define blueprints for creating objects, including both the structure (properties) and behavior (methods).

3. Enums
Enums provide a way to define a set of named constants, which JavaScript lacks.

enum Role {
  Admin,
  User,
  Guest,
}

let myRole: Role = Role.Admin;
console.log(myRole); // Output: 0

In TypeScript, enum members have numeric values assigned by default, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1.

4. Decorators 
Decorators allow meta-programming and are used in Angular.

5. Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing
Although optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) exist in modern JavaScript, TypeScript integrates them better.

let user = { name: "Alice", address: null };
console.log(user.address?.city); //  Undefined instead of error

let input: string | null = null;
console.log(input ?? "Default Value"); //  "Default Value"

6. void type

TypeScript introduces void to explicitly specify that a function does not return a value.
eg: 
function logMessage(): void {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}



7. Generics
Generics allow functions and classes to work with multiple types while maintaining type safety.

function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

console.log(identity<string>("Hello")); //  Works
console.log(identity<number>(42)); // Works

8. Type Aliases & Union Types
JavaScript does not support explicit union types.

TS eg: 
type ID = number | string;

let userId: ID = 101; //  Works
userId = "ABC123"; //  Works
userId = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to 'ID'

Union types are useful when a value can be of multiple types, such as function parameters, return types, or object properties.



9. Tuples
TypeScript allows fixed-length arrays with specific types.

let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 25]; // Works
person = [25, "Alice"]; // Error: Type mismatch


10. Type Assertions
Type assertions help the compiler treat values as a specific type.

let someValue: unknown = "Hello";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;

11. Utility Types (Built-in Helpers)
TypeScript has built-in utility types for common transformations.

eg: Record<K, T> is a built-in utility type that creates an object type with specific keys (K) and values (T).

Example: Mapping Keys to Values
===
type UserRoles = Record<string, string>;

const roles: UserRoles = {
  admin: "Full Access",
  user: "Limited Access",
  guest: "Read Only",
};

 Works fine because both keys (string) and values (string) match the type.

 Nested Record
Record can also store complex objects.
=====
type UserInfo = Record<string, { name: string; age: number }>;

const users: UserInfo = {
  user1: { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  user2: { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
};


12. Namespace
A namespace in TypeScript is used to group related code together under a single name, 
preventing variable and function name conflicts.

namespace MyNamespace {
  export const greeting = "Hello, TypeScript!";
  
  export function sayHello(name: string) {
    return `${greeting} Welcome, ${name}!`;
  }
}

// Accessing namespace members
console.log(MyNamespace.sayHello("Alice")); // O/P: Hello, TypeScript! Welcome, Alice!


13.  ! (non-null assertion operator) 
! prevents TypeScript errors for uninitialized properties.
! suppresses TypeScript's strict null checking, allowing us to declare it without an initial value.
====
eg:
private dateInput!: HTMLInputElement;

To fix it without !, you could do:
private dateInput: HTMLInputElement | null = null;
